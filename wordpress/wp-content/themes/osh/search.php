</table><p>4. How to Register.</p><p>1) Entry Limitations</p><p>Entrant
    may ONLY enter himself or herself into one (1) Prize Pool: the Prize Pool tied to the Carter’s|OshKosh Store closest
    in physical proximity to the Entrant’s place of residence at the time of entry (the Entrant’s “Home Prize Pool”).
    Entrant may, instead of entering him or herself into his or her Home Prize Pool, enter one (1) consenting friend or
    family member (a “Nominee”) into the Prize Pool tied to the Carter’s|OshKosh Store closest in proximity to the
    Nominee’s place of residence at the time of entry (similarly, a Nominee’s “Home Prize Pool”). Entrant may only enter
    a Nominee into one (1) Prize Pool: said Nominee’s Home Prize Pool. For sake of clarity, Entrant may either enter
    himself or herself into the Contest OR enter one (1) Nominee into the Contest.</p><p>For example, if
    an Entrant lives in North Bay, Entrant may: a) enter himself or herself into his or her Home Prize Pool (i.e. the
    North Bay Prize Pool) OR b) enter a Nominee into the Nominee’s Home Prize Pool.</p><p>2)
    Registration Process</p><p>(i) Regardless of whether Entrant wishes to be eligible to win a Prize
    Package or wishes to nominate a Nominee to be eligible to win a Prize Package, the Entrant must register by
    completing the following steps:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li><p>Visit www.cartersoshkosh.ca/carterscomingsoon (the “Contest Page”) during the Contest Period
            and follow the on-screen instructions which will require you to: (i) provide your first and last name, email
            address, and mailing address; and (ii) agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these Rules
            and Regulations.</p></li>
    <li><p>If you wish to enter yourself into your Home Prize Pool, select the proper Carter’s
            Store|OshKosh location from the drop-down menu and then skip to step 2(i)(d) below.</p></li>
    <li><p>If you instead wish to enter a Nominee into a Prize Pool, and you have their explicit consent
            to do so, select the Nominee’s Home Prize Pool from the drop-down menu. You will then be prompted to provide
            the Nominee’s name. You can ONLY enter one (1) Nominee and you can only enter the Nominee into one (1) Prize
            Pool: the Nominee’s Home Prize Pool. Proceed to step 2(i)(d) below.</p></li>
    <li><p>Once you have fully completed the registration form with all required information, click the
            “Submit” button to complete the registration (“Registration”). For an Entrant or a Nominee to be eligible
            for a Prize Package, the relevant Registration must be fully completed, submitted, and received during the
            applicable Prize Pool “Entry Window”: each Prize Pool’s Entry Window is defined as the period between said
            Prize Pool’s Opening Date and Closing Date (see the table in section 3 above). For example, if you live in
            North Bay and you wish to enter into your Home Prize Pool (North Bay), you must submit your completed
            Registration between 9:00 AM ET on July 18, 2016 (the North Bay Opening Date) and 11:59 PM ET on September
            11, 2016 (the North Bay Closing Date). You only need to register one (1) time in this Contest, and you may
            only register once for the Contest.</p></li>
</ol><p>(ii) While not required to complete your Registration, you will be invited to opt-in to the
    Sponsor’s email database (and thereby agree to receive future marketing materials, newsletters, and/or Sponsor
    related news from the Sponsor via email).</p><p>(iii) You may only enter a Nominee from whom you
    have received explicit permission to provide their name to the Sponsor. You may only enter a Nominee with whom you
    have had a direct voluntary two-way communication, and with whom you have a personal relationship. You cannot enter
    any Nominee more than once.</p><p>5. How to Obtain Entries</p><p>If you have
    successfully completed the Registration for the Contest during the applicable Prize Pool Entry Window (see section 4
    above), Entrant or Nominee, as applicable, will be granted one (1) entry into the relevant Prize Pool. For sake of
    clarity, the Entrant’s successful Registration for the Contest will either: a) grant the Entrant one (1) entry into
    the Contest; OR b) grant the Nominee one (1) entry into the Contest, as applicable. Entrant may only complete the
    Registration ONCE. Despite the foregoing, Entrant (or Nominee) may be entered multiple times into the Contest
    provided that each entry for the Entrant (or Nominee) is entered by a different person and provided that the Entrant
    (or Nominee) does not enter him or herself into the Contest more than once. Further, no person, whether an Entrant
    or a Nominee, may be entered into a Prize Pool other than his or her applicable Home Prize Pool.</p><p
   ><span lang="en-GB">6. </span><span lang="en-GB">Draw date. </span></p><p>i) Prize
    Package Draw Dates: There will be a total of six (6) random draws (one (1) for each Carter’s Store|OshKosh Prize
    Pool) (each a “Draw”). One (1) Entrant will be selected in each Draw. The Draws will be held at 10 AM ET in Toronto,
    Ontario at the head office of the Administrator on or about the dates listed below (each a “Draw Date”); for
    example, the Draw Date for the LaSalle Prize Pool is August 17, 2016. Each Draw will contain all eligible entries
    received for that particular Prize Pool by Sponsor during the applicable Prize Pool’s Entry Window; for example, the
    LaSalle Prize Pool will include all eligible entries received by Sponsor during the LaSalle Prize Pool’s Entry
    Window (i.e. between the LaSalle Prize Pool’s Opening Date 9 AM ET on June 22, 2016 and the LaSalle Prize Pool’s
    Closing Date 11:59 PM ET on August 14, 2016; see the table in section 3 for details) and entered into the LaSalle
    Prize Pool.</p><p>Odds of any entry being selected as eligible to win any Prize Package depend on
    the total number of Entries received for that particular Prize Pool during that particular Prize Pool’s Entry
    Window.</p><p>Sponsor will contact selected Entrants via the email address provided in the relevant
    Registrations and will be provide instructions outlining how the Entrant must respond to Sponsor’s notice; if a
    Nominee is selected as a potential winner, the Entrant will be contacted with instructions for how the Nominee must
    respond to Sponsor’s notice, and Nominee must sign a release indicating that Nominee agrees to be bound by these
    Rules and Regulations. Sponsor will contact the selected Entrants no later than three (3) days after the applicable
    draw.</p>
